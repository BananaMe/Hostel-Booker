# Hostel Booker

This is an application based on the concept of booking 
rooms and storing room details. Made using Asp .NET Core 7 and SolidJS typescript.

**It is not fully functioning with some missing CRUD operations and a responsive frontend.**

The app  can perform some tasks like add hostels, updat hostels (by changing the name of the hostel) read a specific hostel (returns the name) or all registered hostels, delete specific hostel (by entering the id of the hostel), adding rooms, updating rooms (WIP), read available rooms (returns registered rooms in a hostel that are available on the specified date range - WIP), delete specific room (by entering the room id and the hostel id the room belongs to), add a guest (by entering the guest's name), read a specific guest (by entering their id) or all registered guests, delete specific guest ( by entering their id)
